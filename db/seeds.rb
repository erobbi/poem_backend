            content: 'I have done it again.\nOne year in every ten\nI manage itâ€”â€”\n\nA sort of walking miracle, my skin\nBright as a Nazi lampshade,\nMy right foot\n\nA paperweight,\nMy face a featureless, fine\nJew linen.\n\nPeel off the napkin\n0 my enemy.\nDo I terrify?â€”â€”\n\nThe nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?\nThe sour breath\nWill vanish in a day.\n\nSoon, soon the flesh\nThe grave cave ate will be\nAt home on me\n\nAnd I a smiling woman.\nI am only thirty.\nAnd like the cat I have nine times to die.\n\nThis is Number Three.\nWhat a trash\nTo annihilate each decade.\n\nWhat a million filaments.\nThe peanut-crunching crowd\nShoves in to see\n\nThem unwrap me hand and foot\nThe big strip tease.\nGentlemen, ladies\n\nThese are my hands\nMy knees.\nI may be skin and bone,\n\nNevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.\nThe first time it happened I was ten.\nIt was an accident.\n\nThe second time I meant\nTo last it out and not come back at all.\nI rocked shut\n\nAs a seashell.\nThey had to call and call\nAnd pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.\n\nDying\nIs an art, like everything else,\nI do it exceptionally well.\n\nI do it so it feels like hell.\nI do it so it feels real.\nI guess you could say I\'ve a call.\n\nIt\'s easy enough to do it in a cell.\nIt\'s easy enough to do it and stay put.\nIt\'s the theatrical\n\nComeback in broad day\nTo the same place, the same face, the same brute\nAmused shout:\n\n\'A miracle!\'\nThat knocks me out.\nThere is a charge\n\nFor the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge\nFor the hearing of my heartâ€”â€”\nIt really goes.\n\nAnd there is a charge, a very large charge\nFor a word or a touch\nOr a bit of blood\n\nOr a piece of my hair or my clothes.\nSo, so, Herr Doktor.\nSo, Herr Enemy.\n\nI am your opus,\nI am your valuable,\nThe pure gold baby\n\nThat melts to a shriek.\nI turn and burn.\nDo not think I underestimate your great concern.\n\nAsh, ash â€”-\nYou poke and stir.\nFlesh, bone, there is nothing thereâ€”â€”\n\nA cake of soap,\nA wedding ring,\nA gold filling.\n\nHerr God, Herr Lucifer\nBeware\nBeware.\n\nOut of the ash\nI rise with my red hair\nAnd I eat men like air.')

I have no preconceptions.\nWhatever I see I swallow immediately\nJust as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.\nI am not cruel, only truthful â€š\nThe eye of a little god, four-cornered.\nMost of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.\nIt is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long\nI think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.\nFaces and darkness separate us over and over.')
