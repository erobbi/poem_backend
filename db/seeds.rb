I have no preconceptions.\nWhatever I see I swallow immediately\nJust as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.\nI am not cruel, only truthful â€š\nThe eye of a little god, four-cornered.\nMost of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.\nIt is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long\nI think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.\nFaces and darkness separate us over and over.')
